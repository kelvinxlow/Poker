# Poker
This project allows the user to play classic Texas hold'em poker in python through the pygame environment.
All elements of standard Texas hold'em poker were replicated to allow the player to enter a game against 5 other computer controlled players.
Through random number generation and analysis of hand strength, the opponents are built to react to different situations.
OOP is used throughout to simplify the code and make for a great experience
